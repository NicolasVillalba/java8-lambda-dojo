1. Any class wins over any interface. So if there’s a method with a body, or an abstract
   declaration, in the superclass chain, we can ignore the interfaces completely.

2. Subtype wins over supertype. If we have a situation in which two interfaces are
   competing to provide a default method and one interface extends the other, the
   subclass wins.

3. No rule 3. If the previous two rules don’t give us the answer, the subclass must either
   implement the method or declare it abstract.


Rule 1 is what brings us compatibility with old code.
